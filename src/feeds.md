Given that RSS feeds are kind of [a thing][post] for me, it's not much of a
surprise to discover that this blog is replete with feeds.

- **All Posts**
  Maybe you're bored. Maybe you're lonely. I'm not here to judge.
  Whatever reason it is, you've found yourself in a place where you're
  subscribing to all the posts from this microblog.
  ([<small>RSS</small>][rss-ap] / [<small>JSON</small>][json-ap])

- **Weeknotes**
  This is more like it. You're the discerning kind of stalker.
  Someone who wants to show they care but not in, like, a super creepy kind of
  way. ([<small>RSS</small>][rss-wn] / [<small>JSON</small>][json-wn])

OK, perhaps 'replete' was overstating it a bit.

Oh, and there is also a [newsletter][email-wn] for the weeknotes if that's more
your thing.
