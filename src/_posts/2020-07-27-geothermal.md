After reading about [ammonia becoming part of Japan's future energy mix](https://www.ft.com/content/254e44c4-afec-11ea-94fc-9a676a727e5a), I did a quick search as to why geothermal energy doesn't play a larger role here. Looks like it's at least partly due to [local opposition in candidate sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_Japan).
