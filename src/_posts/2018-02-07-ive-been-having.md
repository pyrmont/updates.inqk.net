I’ve been having an issue using Mosh, Vim and Screen together. After a period of time, the arrow keys stop working properly. According to [this](https://superuser.com/questions/1197868/arrow-keys-dont-work-when-using-mosh-remote-shell), `:set term=builtin_ansi` fixes it. It did for me but I don’t understand why.
