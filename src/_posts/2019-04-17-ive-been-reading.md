I've been reading Ben Thompson for a long time and have been frustrated by his (albeit well-meaning) hand-wringing over regulation. At a point, worrying about unintended consequences becomes a decision not to regulate. I'm glad [he's finally proposed something](https://stratechery.com/2019/a-regulatory-framework-for-the-internet/).
