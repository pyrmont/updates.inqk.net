There was a good discussion initiated by [@jasonshew](https://micro.blog/jasonshew) about a Beijing ad for a English classes promising more native accents. I don't have an opinion on the ad but it reminded me of the way in which Japanese learners of English limit themselves by not embracing their own accent.
