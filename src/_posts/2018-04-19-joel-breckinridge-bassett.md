Joel Breckinridge Bassett has been [documenting Suica error flicker on the iPhone X](https://atadistance.net/?s=Suica+error+flicker). I don't plan to upgrade this cycle but this makes me worried when I eventually do. Hopefully it's fixed by then but it's not confidence inspiring how long this problem has been outstanding.
