- I continued working on [Ecstatic](https://github.com/pyrmont/ecstatic) and continued avoiding releasing [Flext]( https://github.com/pyrmont/flext). Ecstatic will now generate a website from a set of files, similar to Jekyll. It can also generate archives for the blog posts that it finds. Before I consider it at version 1, I want it to include a development web server and a way to watch for changes to a watched directory. The former is easy enough to do with [Circlet](https://github.com/janet-lang/circlet); the latter is proving to be not so straightforward.

- I switched my iPhone system language to English. I've been running my iPhones in Japanese since I got my first one (or at least that's how I remember it). Partly it was a way to practise reading Japanese, partly it was because it's the only way to have your Contacts offer proper sorting of Japanese names. The thing is that since I basically never call anyone in my Contacts, how their name is sorted isn't really that critical.

- As my updates over the week attest, I've had a fun time watching the NBA Conference Finals. Part of me was disappointed that the Denver Nuggets were unable to advance but part of me enjoys watching LeBron James defy time. I never thought I'd consider anyone could top Michael Jordan on my 'greatest of all time' list but James is making me question that.

- Eri has a couple of Western TV shows that she tends to rewatch periodically and one of them is _The Mentalist_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mentalist)). After seeing people compare it to _Psych_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych)), we decided to give that a go but couldn't make it through the first episode. I'm not sure if it improves but I found the humour horribly forced and the POV shots where the protagonist uses his hypersensitive observation skills profoundly distracting. Give me Simon Baker smiling coyly any day of the week. 

- Monday and Tuesday were public holidays and I took the kids out on the bicycle on Monday and promptly managed to puncture the back wheel so badly I had to push the bike home. Fortunately, I was able to get it repaired the next day at the new(ish) cycle shop that opened a few months back. Eri and I are almost certainly getting Emma a bicycle as a present for either Christmas or her birthday so it was also a good excuse to check out their range.

- How good a songwriter is Neil Finn? The answer—via Clare Bowditch—is very good ([Apple Music]( https://music.apple.com/us/album/fall-at-your-feet/1321068787?i=1321069375)).
