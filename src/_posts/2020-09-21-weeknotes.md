- I turned 38. Eri organised a small cake and the kids made hand-drawn birthday cards. I had to go into the office during the day so I, of course, took the opportunity to grab lunch at Mos Burger.

- In what looks like a desperate attempt to avoid actually releasing [Flext](https://github.com/pyrmont/flext/), I began a completely new project. [Ecstatic](https://github.com/pyrmont/ecstatic/) is a static site website generator in Janet. It's been a while since I did anything in Janet and it was fun to be writing in a Lisp again. It doesn't quite work yet but it's mostly there, I think.

- I got an e-mail from Pinboard, the bookmarking service that I use, notifying me that my subscription needs to be renewed by early next month. I was disappointed to see that the annual fee for the service has increased from the $25 it was last year to $39 this year. While the overall service generally works fine, when I've needed to e-mail support, I've been consistently disappointed. Often the initial e-mail is never answered at all. That's not the kind of service that puts you in a good mood for a 50% year-on-year price jump. I'm a long-time fan of the site's operator, Maciej Ceglowski, so perhaps thinking of this as a charitable donation is the best approach. Or maybe that's _another_ side project into which I could lose myself.

- I upgraded to iOS 14 and am finding the new photos widget you can put on the home screen an absolute delight. I didn't think I was going to try the widgets out at all, but after [Brandon](https://sangsara.net) told me it was his favourite feature, I gave it a shot and surprised myself with how much I liked it.

- After finally finishing _Cowboy Bebop_ after starting it several times, Eri and I moved on to another anime series I've started on multiple occasions but never finished, _Lovely Complex_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Com)). The show is set in the city of Sakai which is particularly resonant for me because that's where I worked when I was on the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JET_Programme)).

- After not watching much of this NBA season (and wondering whether I should even be paying for NBA League Pass), I've really enjoyed the playoffs this year. The series between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets was especially great. While I wanted a Clippers/Lakers Western Conference Finals, watching the Nuggets claw their way back and eventually triumph was great theatre.

- I listened to Kinobe's 'Slip Into Something More Comfortable' ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/slip-into-something-more-comfortable/294633847?i=294633909)) for the first time in what may have been more than a decade.
