- This was technically the weekend before but we celebrated Easter Sunday by giving the kids some chocolate eggs. I wasn't on the ball and by the time I went looking on Amazon for large, hollow, chocolate eggs, the delivery dates were all after Easter but I managed to nab some smaller eggs and the kids fortunately didn't care.

- The surge in COVID-19 cases I mentioned last week continued to get worse ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tokyo-emergency-idUSKBN2BV0HT)). My concern at the moment is that even once vaccinations roll out more broadly, the virus will mutate into a form that prevents herd immunity developing and we'll be right back where we started. The numbers in the U.S., while initially declining, appear to have hit a worryingly stable plateau.

- Despite the increase in cases, Emma started her final year of pre-school on Friday. This is about the most trite thing I could say, I realise, but boy does time fly. It does not feel like two years ago that we were taking her there for the first time. 

- My monthly visit to see the doctor was on Monday. Despite it being monthly, I actually forgot it was on and would have missed it but for the fact that I got a warning on my Mac that I needed to leave if I was going to make it on public transport. This is the first time that feature has been useful but I'm glad it was there.

- I'm a regular viewer of the video essays on the  [Philosophy Tube channel](https://youtube.com/c/thephilosophytube). Philosophy Tube is written and performed by Abigail Thorn, an actress and university philosophy graduate. In February, Thorn [announced in a video](https://youtu.be/AITRzvm0Xtg) that she had transitioned (she was previously Oliver Thorn). I've found the transitionâ€¦ difficult. I think of myself as pro-trans in the abstract but admit that that I'm uncomfortable with the phenomenon in practice. I recognise it as bigotry and assume it's similar to how some older people felt as homosexuality became normalised in the 90s. All of this is to say that I watched my [first essay](https://youtu.be/m81q-ZkfBm0) since the transition. It was fine.

- I continued spending a lot of time working on the rewrite of my CommonMark parser. Still nothing to show publicly yet but I'm making steady progress through the examples in the specification.

- Eri and I started watching _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_. We've watched some of these episodes before but stopped for reasons I don't remember now. We'll see how far we get this time.

- Meanwhile, I'm now up to season four of _Law & Order_ and am at the point where I've started to remember the basic details of the episodes. One thing that I didn't remember was the ice cold way they dropped the characters of Captain Cragen and Paul Robinette from the show. No explanation, no nothing. The new season commences and they're gone. I realise it was an important tenet of the show that episodes not focus on the lives of the characters but it's a little odd that nobody even mentions it. That said, I really like both Lieutenant Van Buren and Claire Kincaid so I'm excited they're now in the regular cast.

- I don't usually listen to songs on repeat but as I was working through some difficult parsing logic in the CommonMark parser, I found a sort of serenity in putting 'Los Muertos Vivos Estan' from the _Spectre_ soundtrack on loop ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/los-muertos-vivos-estan-feat-tambuco/1440846171?i=1440846385)).
