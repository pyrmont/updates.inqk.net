Signed up for Twitter Blue without realising that it [doesn't remove ads](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue#tbadfree). That's my fault but I then immediately cancelled it. Given I've never intentionally clicked on a Twitter ad in my life, seems like a lost opportunity for Twitter.
