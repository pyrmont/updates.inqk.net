- There are still so many boxes. I'm going very slowly, in part because it's very difficult to get time away from Rowan at the moment. I can't remember now if Emma or John did this but he's entered the squealing phase where he'll frequently start squealing if he's left alone.

- I returned the key to the old house. As part of that process, the real estate agent conducted an inspection of the property. It went pretty well overall, I think, although there is some damage here and there that they'll rectify at my expense. I won't consider things truly completed until the final account is settled. The agent needs to coordinate with the landlord so not sure exactly how long that will take.

- Eri took Emma down to the primary school she'll attend from this month. The entrance ceremony for new students is next Wednesday with classes to commence from Thursday.

- We're still not sure what we'll do about John's preschool. There's one very close to our house which is the obvious choice but it requires children to bring their own lunches. That's unfortunate as neither Eri nor I much care to put in the amount of effort that typically requires. The school itself also lacks the grassed area that Emma's old preschool featured. That's not unusual (it was unusual Emma's school had such an area) but it does help explain why families in Tokyo often want to move to the suburbs.

- This is from last week but Russia seems to be revising its war aims to no longer include regime change ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-goals.html)). Mark me down as someone who didn't give the Ukrainians much of a chance at keeping Kyiv. 

- The New York Times had an [article about Japan's entry requirements](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/travel/japan-covid-tourism-border.html) on Saturday that suggested we shouldn't expect any change to tourist entry until at least the upcoming elections are held in July. As Mum pointed out, that would mean that she wouldn't be able to get over here for the John and Rowan's birthdays (which are both in June).

- I haven't done much programming for most of this year and I'm not sure that's going to change. Part of the issue is the lack of free time but part of it is that I've been in a bit of a funk about languages and toolchains. Lisps have raised the bar of the interactive experience I want and while that makes the obvious choice Clojure, I still can't get over the fact that it's built on Java. Having even gone so far as to consider porting Clojure to a host language I prefer instead, I appreciate that it's Java's (and really the JVM's) unusual support for runtime features in a compile-time language that make it such a good choice and yet... it's just so _heavy_.

- I haven't had a chance to watch much this week. Dave mentioned in passing the Defunctland YouTube channel and I did watch a couple of its videos. My family was fortunate enough to be able to go on a round the world trip when I was 11 and one of the highlights at the time was being able to visit Euro Disneyland. So of course the first video I watched was the one about the [Failure of Euro Disneyland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFE8RlKlLCE).

- The Internet continues to work fine. I played some Rocket League for the first time since the move and the latency of the connection was perfectly fine.

- It's been a while since I've listened any I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME but Apple Music suggested 'Absinthe' from _1981 Extended Play_. It's only 16 minutes but that is a fun EP ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/1981-extended-play-ep/1441477155)).
