- The Australian Government notified me that Rowan's citizenship application has been approved. I haven't received the certificate yet but hopefully that arrives in the next week or so.

- Of course that would happen at the end of the week in which I'd lodged the passport applications for Emma, John and me. Now I need to make a second trip to the Australian Embassy. I have already booked that; fortunately I was able to get a spot at the end of this month.

- School holidays are rough. No doubt things are made worse by the ongoing pandemic, particularly the BA.5 variant that seems so contagious. And having day after day of 35+ degree heat isn't conducive to doing much outside either. But still, we've got a month or so to go and I cannot wait for the kids to be back at school.

- That said, if it wasn't school holidays, Emma and John would be at home anyway because they're both sick. As is Rowan. I mentioned last week that John had come down with something and it spread to all the kids. Neither Eri nor I have come down with it which is something I guess. When Eri took the kids to the paediatrician, he thought it was most likely a cold.

- I'm not sure the dieting is going particularly well. Or to be more correct, I don't think I'm doing a good job of dieting. I'm not sure what to do. Well, no, that's not true. I'm not sure if I want to do what I need to do which is really just to stop snacking.

- I finally got around to giving _Diablo Immortal_ a go on the iPad with my Xbox controller. The core mechanic of the game feels very akin to _Diablo II_ which could be read as a criticism but I mean it as a compliment. I'm reminded of how much time Dave and I spent playing the game at netcafes at the turn of the century (a scary amount).

- One of the reasons I've got time to play Diablo is that I finished the steps in the MAL course. I'm not sure if what I've got is that helpful in making my Lisp on Ruby project a reality but it did feel good to at least get to the end and see my interpreter successfully self-host the MAL implementation that comes as part of the repository.

- John Gruber at Daring Fireball linked to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/28/arts/comedian-water-bottle-standup.html) about comedians and water bottles and, if you're interested at all in stand-up comedy, it's a delightful way to spend a few minutes.

- I was trying to sing 'Jailhouse Rock' to Rowan at one point when I vaguely remembered a black and white version I'd seen when I was a child. I thought it was from a television broadcast but of course what I was remembering was the famous scene from the movie _Jailhouse Rock_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_Rock_(film))). I'm not sure if it'll be restricted to certain geographies but I was able to watch a crisp, clear version on the Turner Classic Movies YouTube channel ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/MfrC8PAQtlg)).

- That would probably do for the musical selection but I wanted instead to link to Richard Ashcroft's _Acoustic Hymns, Vol. 1_ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/acoustic-hymns-vol-1/1580464665)). If the name doesn't ring a bell, he was the lead singer of British rock group, the Verve, and the album includes a number of the Verve's better known numbers, including 'Bitter Sweet Symphony' (spelt 'Bittersweet Symphony'), 'Lucky Man' and 'The Drugs Don't Work'.
