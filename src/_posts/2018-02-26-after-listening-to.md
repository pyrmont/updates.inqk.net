After listening to [@gruber](https://micro.blog/gruber) and [@marco](https://micro.blog/marco) [discuss to do apps](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/02/18/ep-215), I've decided to try out Things. Since free time is largely restricted, I want to have an app (with Siri integration) where I keep to do items for doing on my commute.
