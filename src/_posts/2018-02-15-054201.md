[Good piece](http://joecieplinski.com/blog/2018/02/14/good-vs-better-at-bad/) by [@joec](https://micro.blog/joec) about ‘smart’ speakers but I wanted to answer [a stray aside](http://joecieplinski.com/blog/2018/02/14/good-vs-better-at-bad/#fn6) about the name of Google’s Assistant. ([@gruber](https://micro.blog/gruber) wondered the same thing.) [It _is_ Google Assistant](https://blog.google/products/assistant/new-google-assistant-updates-made-just-for-your-home/). The complicating element is that it’s just ‘OK (or hey) Google’ to trigger it.
