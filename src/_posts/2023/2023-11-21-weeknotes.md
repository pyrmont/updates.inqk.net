- It's finally getting cold enough that we've been putting the heater on at night. The days themselves have been a beautiful blend of plentiful sunshine and crisp autumn air. I wish this was the weather we'd been subjected to for the past few months.

- It was Eri's birthday. I bought the seasonal [tart collection](https://www.cozycorner.co.jp/campaign/newitem/86772.html) from the local Ginza Cosy Corner and the kids and I sung 'happy birthday' after dinner.

- I took Emma and John to get their second shots of the flu vaccine. Emma was very good the first time but John snuck out of the doctor's office during Emma's shot and then squirmed to such an extent that I was afraid the doctor might say it was too dangerous to try to make the injection. I'm proud to say both Emma and John were excellent this time.

- Speaking of needles, I ducked out on Tuesday morning and got my COVID shot for this year. I booked it through a website that the local city runs and unlike last year, there were very slim pickings in our area. I discovered later that you could book directly with some of the closer clinics but it was such a nice morning (see the first bullet point) that I didn't end up minding having an excuse to walk further afield. I was a little surprised that there was no mandatory period where I had to wait after receiving the shot. They jabbed me and then said I was fine to leave straightaway.

- One disappointing thing about the weather was that while the conditions on Sunday were absolutely perfect for a visit to Disneyland, everyone clearly had the same idea and there were no tickets available. Instead, Eri and I took the kids over to Toyosu. Rowan was surprisingly good on the roughly hour train ride (albeit distracted for most of that time by an iPad) so taking the train to Disneyland (which is about 20 minutes further away) doesn't seem completely out of the question.

- A couple of weeks ago, OpenAI announced that premium users could setup and use customised versions of ChatGPT called GPTs. Brandon has thrown himself fully into the effort creating GPTs to [put you sleep](https://sangsara.net/2023/11/12/two-storytelling-gpts-sleepytales-and-sleepykills/), [advise on photo filters](https://sangsara.net/2023/11/11/introducing-pixelgenius-gpt-an-ai-photo-editing-expert/) and [discuss movies](https://sangsara.net/2023/11/15/filmnerd-gpt/) amongst others! I'm a little ashamed to say that the one that grabbed my attention the most was his [interactive astrologer](https://sangsara.net/2023/11/19/co-sign/). Alas, Brandon might have done too good job. Years ago a mother of a friend had told me that I was a [triple Virgo](https://thefab20s.com/triple-virgo/), a result that flattered my ego and seemed to fit with my personality. But it's not true! According to Coâ€”Sign, I am a mere mixture of Virgo, Leo and Cancer.

- I realised I'd discovered this already but I was disappointed all over again to see that Disney's _Wish_ doesn't come out until Friday 15 December. I'd thought it might be something I could go and see with Ferdinando. Fortunately, it comes out in Australia on Boxing Day so we'll at least be able to see it there.

- I was comparing my Replay 2023 playlist to my Replay 2022 playlist in Apple Music and was a touch disappointed to see how few new artists there were compared to last year. The release of the drumless edition of _Random Access Memories_ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/random-access-memories-drumless-edition/1708115055)) isn't improving things.
