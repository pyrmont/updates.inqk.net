- My grandmother died the week prior and her funeral was on Friday. I'm sad I didn't get to speak to her one last time but I also know it wouldn't have been what I wanted; namely, to go back in time and talk to the person she used to be before her condition deteriorated about a decade ago. I really wanted the kids to meet that version of her. She was the first person I remember who considered it a matter of fact that Australian land was rightfully Indigenous land. I will miss her and the person she was.

- In a somewhat related vein, the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice Referendum ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Indigenous_Voice_referendum)) was voted down on Saturday. Australia has a difficult constitution to amend so this isn't a shock but it was a little surprising that, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory, every state (together with the Northern Territory) was majority no. From what I've seen online, I am unlike most yes supporters in that I don't think that this is incontrovertible proof of the Australian population's racist attitudes. While I think creating a voice to parliament ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Voice_to_Parliament)) would have been an important (and morally justified) step in integrating Australia's Indigenous population into its governing structure, I am sympathetic to people who were concerned about the consequences of such an innovative idea. Personally, as someone who thinks it's a great strength of federalism that you can experiment with different approaches, I would have waited until it had more of a track record at the state level but I understand why the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people didn't want to have to wait _even longer_ for more recognition.

- I had a blind pimple ([Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22913-blind-pimple)) and in trying to explain what this was to Eri I discovered that Japan apparently doesn't have them or at least doesn't have a word to describe them.

- Boomers criticise Millennials for having a lack of impulse control and maybe that's what this is but I couldn't resist buying the kids a new Switch game. John especially loves playing on the Nintendo and I should have got him one for his birthday rather than the subscription to the educational game I got instead. In any case, I bought _Yoshi's Craft World_ second-hand and it's gone down a real treat. I was worried he and Emma might find it too basic but that's turned out not to be the case.

- As mentioned [last week](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1696947360.html), I've started rewatching the first season of _Loki_. I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson's chemistry. I also appreciate how clever the show is at playing within its own rules.

- I never enjoyed _Rogue One_ as much as some other people did and I often wonder what the 'original' cut of the film was like. Were you not aware there was an earlier cut of the film? The YouTube channel, Bullets & Blockbusters, does a decent job explaining what we know about it in a [10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ngevf9-ujg) if you're curious.

- Japanese television producers frequently sprinkle in music from famous soundtracks to random segments of panel or variety shows. During one such show that was on this week, I heard Quincy Jones' 'Soul Bossa Nova' and have had it in my head ever since ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/soul-bossa-nova/1444105286?i=1444105709)).
