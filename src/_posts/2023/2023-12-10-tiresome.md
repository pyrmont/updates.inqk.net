I'm sure some of this is my privilege as a white man but I find the constant doomerism about the Internet tiresome (e.g. [this episode](https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/why-the-internet-is-getting-worse-and-why-that-might-be-good-for-society) of the paid podcast Sharp Tech). I've been on the Internet since 1996 and still find it such a marvel.
