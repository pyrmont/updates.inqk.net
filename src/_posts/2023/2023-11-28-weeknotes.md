- Thursday was another public holiday. It'd been a while since we'd been to a 'family restaurant' and so we trekked over to one of the closer ones: Jonathan's. We used to go to a Jonathan's near our old place about once a month and my memory is of the food being decent. Either my memory is wrong or things have taken a turn. Fortunately, we walked home via a park we don't normally visit and Emma, John and Rowan had a blast.

- Plenty of shops in Tokyo put up their Christmas decorations the day after Hallowe'en but I resisted bringing out our 'decorations' (really just a Christmas tree) until Saturday. I probably should have waited until the start of Advent but since we're leaving this year on 16 December, if I wait til this coming Sunday, the tree will be up for less than two weeks.

- I won one of the nightly 3v3 tournaments in _Rocket League_ and it was a reminder why I keep playing the game. Coming into the final, we had easily swept through our best of three semi-final whereas our opponent had lost the first game before clawing their way back. Their results throughout the tournament lulled me into thinking our victory was a fait accompli. Forgive me, for dropping sports cliche after sports cliche but after being thoroughly embarrassed in the first game, we pulled together as a team to draw even after the second. The final game was a nail-biter with the game going to overtime where our sharpshooter scored the winning goal.

- Oh, and the Australian cricket team did well too, I guess ([ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-19/live-updates-cricket-world-cup-final-india-vs-australia/103124084)).

- It's been a while since I've done any programming and I got the itch again. For ages now, I've wanted a collaborative crossword app that I could do with Eugenia. I've gone back and forth about doing it as an iOS app or a web app. Trying it as a web app won out and I started hacking something together using [Squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint) and [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com). I don't have that much working at the moment but I do have a webpage that automatically updates as I change the code.

- Tanner Greer wrote about a [new translated excerpts](https://scholars-stage.org/wang-huning-and-the-eternal-return-to-1975/) of Wang Huning's travelogue _America Against America_. Huning wrote the travelogue in 1975 and marvels at the transformative power of American society. Much of that amazement makes for bracing reading today. As Greer observes:
  
  > Wang’s confidence in American ambition is expressed in a one particularly painful passage:

On the contrary, people would think this was an amazing idea.'

  > These are not new sentiments. [Foreigners were saying things like this about the American people all the way back in the 1820s](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/03/30/a-school-of-strength-and-character/). I do not think this would be most foreign visitors first observations about Americans today. It is, however, the sort of thing foreign visitors say about China. If a road was to be built across the Pacific today, we would expect the Chinese to build it.

  I'm not American but it did make me wonder if I should have lived a more ambitious life.

- I often find myself merely skimming posts on Patrick McKenzie's (relatively) new blog, [Bits about Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com) (which is a terrific name), but [his latest](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/bond-villain-compliance-strategy/) on Binance and Changpeng Zhao was excellent. This was one of my favourite bits:

  > Binance also operated in the state of Heisenbergian uncertainty, sometimes known as Malta. Malta has a substantial financial services industry, which [welcomed Binance with open arms](https://www.reuters.com/article/finance-crypto-currency-binance/special-report-crypto-giant-binance-kept-weak-money-laundering-checks-even-as-it-promised-tougher-compliance-documents-show-idUSL8N2U065F/) in 2018 and then [pretended not to know him](https://www.mfsa.mt/news-item/public-statement-2020/) in 2020. This continues Malta’s proud tradition of strategic ambiguity as to whether it is an EU country or rentable skin suit for money launderers.

- I watched them both in fits and starts but I finished both the [1974 version](https://letterboxd.com/pyrmont/film/murder-on-the-orient-express/) and the [2017 version](https://letterboxd.com/pyrmont/film/murder-on-the-orient-express-2017/) of _Murder on the Orient Express_. I gather my opinion aligns with the critical consensus: Branagh is too focused on making the film 'exciting' to make a good murder mystery. I concur strongly with Danny Boyle's [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGx9Xt0EEk).

- After lamenting the lack of new music in my media diet last week, I feel especially guilty linking to a greatest hits album. And yet, what a greatest hits album. If you're remotely curious about Australian hip-hop, the _Highlights_ from Hilltop Hoods is the place to start ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-highlights/1715218916)).
