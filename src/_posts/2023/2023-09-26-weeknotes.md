- Monday was [Respect for the Aged Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_for_the_Aged_Day). Too soon, Japan. Too soon.

- I just checked I didn't make that joke in [last year's post](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1663646220.html) because I couldn't remember. I believe this is called irony.

- I had the second examination on Friday. The doctor seemed pleased with the progress overall but identified one location where things were going more slowly than she'd like. It doesn't sound like there's anything I can do about it other than wait. She did give me a referral to a dermatologist that specialises in hair removal and explained that there's a risk of reinfection if the hair around the wound grows back. Unfortunately I'm still not supposed to sit down and it wasn't clear when that's meant to change. The next examination is in four weeks so at least not until then.

- It was beautiful weather on Sunday and I wanted to go somewhere but it needed to be somewhere I could stand up the entire time. An art gallery! I'd never been to the [National Art Center, Tokyo](https://www.nact.jp/english/) but Emma said she was interested in going when I showed her the website for an exhibition called [_LIGHT: Works from the Tate Collection_](https://www.nact.jp/english/exhibition_special/2023/tate/index.html) and so off we went. This might sound like a back-handed compliment but I think it was an excellent exhibition for a seven-year-old. Something centred on the work of a particular artist or period might have been too repetitive; a collection of works spanning two centuries that all relate to light meant enough of a theme for Emma to follow but also enough variety that she didn't get bored. Well, that and the pretty sizeable crowd that meant we had to move at a decent clip.

- The local ward office sent my voucher for the next COVID-19 vaccination. I was surprised (but pleased) to see that it was for the vaccine that targets the XBB subvariant ([NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20230920_13/)). Although the voucher can be used right away, I'm planning to wait until closer to this year's Australia trip to maximise protection in the run-up to that.

- John brought home an arrow-looking thing that he'd made at preschool and proudly declared it was a gun. I was horrified. He doesn't really watch anything with real guns in it but there are blasters in the Star Wars universe so perhaps that's what he was thinking of. I realise there's some rank hypocrisy going on here. I consume media that's filled with guns and don't have a problem with that. I much preferred Eri's suggestion that it was a rocket but John's agreement to call it that was half-hearted at best.

- After taking a break, I caught all the way up to the penultimate episode of _Only Murders in the Building_. It was all fantastic. Tom was correct in the supposition regarding one of the characters that he made early on in season three so congratulations Tom. (Keeping it vague to avoid spoilers for people who haven't seen it. I am looking at you, Brandon.)

- I appreciate the even greater degree of irony in waxing rhapsodic over a show with 'murder' in the title after the gun paragraph.

- No video essays especially grabbed my attention this week but YouTube did suggest [this sketch](https://youtu.be/Yyj5cv5FPWA?si=b45D8Vlii6ycL_Ef) about scale from the absurdist British comedy, _Big Train_.

- The Chemical Brothers released a new album, _For That Beautiful Feeling_, earlier this month ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-that-beautiful-feeling/1694715224)). So far nothing's grabbed me yet but it gave this middle-aged father some warm vibes to see they're still together and still making music.
