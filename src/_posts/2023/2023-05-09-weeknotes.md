- The Japanese Government changed the category of COVID-19 to the same as seasonal influenza ([NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20230507_13/)). Separately, the World Health Organisation announced COVID-19 is no longer a global health emergency ([ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-05/who-says-covid-is-no-longer-a-global-emergency/102311746)).

- Another Golden Week is in the books. It was excellent weather and I was a little disappointed we didn't go somewhere (although, due to the insane numbers of peoples travel is not a particularly fun thing to attempt during the week). Instead of that, on Thursday, Eri took Emma and John to see the _Super Mario Bros_ movie again (this time in Japanese) and then on Friday, we had a picnic with my friend, Ferdinando, and his family.

- Because it was Golden Week, NHK-E departed from their regularly scheduled programming and screened an anthology special where they featured presenters from shows of the past. I'd completely forgotten a bunch of them, none more so than the cast of _Kore Nande Sh≈çkai_ ([NHK](https://www2.nhk.or.jp/archives/movies/?id=D0009040442_00000)). It made me nostalgic for the shows that were on when Emma and John were very little which, I think we can prove with modern science, were objectively better.

- I watched _Crazy, Stupid, Love_ and the _Intern_ because I felt like I watch too many action blockbusters. They were both fine. I did find myself wishing Anne Hathaway had had a better career. She's been very successful but what would you say are her must-see movies? The _Devil Wears Prada_? The _Dark Knight Rises_? Or does that say less about Anne Hathaway and more about the roles for women?

- I was gobsmacked at the [evolution of images](https://sangsara.net/2023/05/07/week-18-23/) Brandon got out of Midjourney for a prompt about Queen Elizabeth II playing Street Fighter in a video game arcade. Brandon had the presence of mind to save the images he's created across various versions and it's really remarkable seeing the improvement.

- I've been a nervous wreck following the travails of the Golden State Warriors in this year's NBA Play-Offs. They looked pretty good against the Sacramento Kings and I was optimistic about their chances against the Los Angeles Lakers but Anthony Davis (when he's been engaged) has been dominant (as explained excellently in [this video essay](https://youtu.be/babxc4dsch0)) and as incredible as Curry has been all play-offs, maybe Game 7 against the Kings will have to be enough for this year.

- Oh, and while I'm talking about all-time great NBA guards, I really enjoyed [this 17-minute breakdown](https://youtu.be/PhLlGi28jSQ) of Jerry West's play-off career. If you've ever wondered if there was more to making him the logo than just racism, the answer is yes.

- If video essays are your thing but not when they're about basketball, I can't recommend enough [this one](https://youtu.be/tiesXqT1P3g) by Listening In on Radiohead's rejected opening song for _Spectre_. It still bothers me all these years later that Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson went with the vastly inferior 'Writing's on the Wall'.

- That of course makes it the obvious musical selection for this week and while I encourage everyone to listen to it ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/spectre/1113546075?i=1113546470)), I actually wanted to link to Marian Hill's _Act One_ this week ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/act-one/1440845571)). I came across the band when the opening single, 'Down', was featured in the first commercial for AirPods ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/WpeQMg6YUH0)).

- Unrelated: AirPods were introduced with the iPhone 7 (?!).
