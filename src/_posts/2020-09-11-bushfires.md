I haven't seen many people noting this but Australia went through [a bushfire (read: wildfire) season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019â€“20_Australian_bushfire_season) over the Southern Hemisphere summer that's similar to what's happening on the U.S. West Coast. We should definitely be concerned this is the new normal.
