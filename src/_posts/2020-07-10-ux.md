I agree with Gruber's [post on the App Store](https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/app_store_moment_of_clarity) but disagree that people using the Gmail app can't recognise a shitty user experience or don't care. I care but I also consider fast search, push notifications, proper labels and undo send part of UX.
