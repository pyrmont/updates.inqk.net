Bought the Chromecast Audio today and it basically solves [my volume problem](http://updates.inqk.net/2018/01/07/i-bought-a.html). I have it plugged into my speakers with all music being cast to it; its volume works independently of the volume of the Home Mini so I can set it to be loud and leave the Chromecast Audio quite soft.
