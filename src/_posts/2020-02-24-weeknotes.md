- [Robin Sloan's post](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) about creating a bespoke app for communicating with his family was the best thing I read this week. It's not particularly long but the gist is about the potential for 'situated software'. I loved this quote:

  > People don’t only learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do! But far more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably, or in a specific way. Or because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they learn just because they’re bored! Or even because--get this--they love spending time with the person who’s teaching them.

- Sloan consciously took the term 'situated software' from an essay by Clay Shirky. It's no longer on Shirky's website (for some reason) but [a version](https://web.archive.org/web/20040411202042/http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html) is available on the Internet Archive.

- Eri and I finished the Hulu Japan/HBO Asia co-production, [_Miss Sherlock_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Sherlock). It took us a little while to get into it but, by the end, we were watching the final two episodes back to back at 3 in the morning.

- If a vibrant reimagining of classic Victorian fiction isn't what you're looking for, I stumbled across a fascinating subculture of YouTube videos of people solving logic puzzles. Here's [an example](https://youtu.be/73Meh3NPno4) of a solution to the Snake Egg puzzle.

- I can't actually remember what prompted this but I started wondering what the correct phrasing was for the 'tangled web we weave' caution about deception. It turns out it's from Walter Scott's 19th Century poem, [_Marmion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmion_(poem)). The quote itself is:

  > Oh, what a tangled web we weave  
  > When first we practise to deceive!

  I've always said 'Oh, what tangled webs we weave / when first we practise to deceive'. With all due respect to Scott, mine is clearly superior.

- Emma turned 4 this week. In some ways it feels like she's been in our lives for the metaphorical blink of an eye and yet four years? I hate to resort to banalities but time sure does fly.

- Speaking of birthdays, Dad's was this week, too. He's 73.

- My aunt swung by on her way back to Australia. She was able to come to Emma's 'party' which was nice. We had planned to spend Saturday out doing something but I didn't feel completely comfortable going out into crowds with the kids. The spread of COVID-19 (in Japan at least) hasn't been as rapid as I was expecting last week but Emma has had nagging respiratory issues so why tempt fate?

- Joe Hisaishi has a new album out called _Dream Songs: The Essential Joe Hisaishi_. It's fine but it mostly reminded me of how incredible his score is to _Spirited Away_ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/spirited-away-original-soundtrack/883501721)).

- I began work on a web-based editor that could update Jekyll posts in a GitHub repo. It's called [Pondent](https://github.com/pyrmont/pondent).
