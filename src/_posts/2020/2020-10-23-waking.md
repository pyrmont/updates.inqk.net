The most interesting detail in [Gruber's review of the iPad Air](https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_2020_ipad_air) is that he wakes his computer with the spacebar. I prefer using a modifier key that won't have an impact by itself (e.g. the OPTION key) and for some reason thought he'd have been the same.
