A little over a month ago, I started developing a [set of Ruby scripts for parsing arbitrary feeds](https://github.com/pyrmont/shakushi). I’ve since become sidetracked implementing a [type checking library](https://github.com/pyrmont/shakushi/blob/master/lib/type_check.rb). There are others out there but sometimes it’s fun to reinvent the wheel.
