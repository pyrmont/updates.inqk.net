Weird: there are two long-form magainze articles out about Amazon this month. It's an interesting contrast. [The one in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/21/is-amazon-unstoppable) isn't _bad_, but [the Atlantic's piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/what-jeff-bezos-wants/598363/) is definitely superior.
