After listening to [@coreint](https://micro.blog/coreint), I signed up for Setapp and while it's interesting, I don't think I'll keep it. Of the apps there that I don't already own, [ToothFairy](https://c-command.com/toothfairy/) was the only one that I could really see myself using long term and I think I'd rather buy it outright.
