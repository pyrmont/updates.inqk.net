This is me truly being a broken record at this point but I continue to feel that the variety of playlists (or at least those being surfaced to me) on Apple Music has improved considerably. [Guitar Throwback](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/guitar-throwback/pl.299001f6c528460797ea61bac6522a81) was a good choice, Siri.
