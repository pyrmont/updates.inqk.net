- For the past couple of months, Eri and I were experiencing Internet connectivity problems with our phones. The phone would not report losing its Wi-Fi connection with our router but a particular request would appear to simply not get through. You'd sit in Safari or YouTube or what have you and the app would be trying to make a connection but it would never complete. If you temporarily switched off Wi-Fi and went back to the cellular connection, the request would immediately complete. I hate debugging networking problems because of the number of variable factors and tried various solutions all to no avail.

- Eventually what _seems_ to have fixed it was setting up a Wi-Fi access point downstairs. We're fortunate that the entire house is wired with Ethernet so it was straightforward to plug in an old router in the living room as a Wi-Fi bridge and switch off the Wi-Fi functionality of our current router. (For architectural reasons, it has to be located on the third floor of our house and I guess the signal was having difficulty reaching downstairs. Why that suddenly started happening a couple of months back, I don't know.)

- I went outside for a medical checkup and possibly irresponsibly went to Mos Burger and bought a Mos Yasai burger meal that I then took to a nearby park to eat. It was the first time I'd eaten lunch outside the house in two months.

- On the way home, I ducked into a supermarket. I don't remember precisely the last time I went to a supermarket but that too might not have happened in two months.

- Emma started going to preschool again. The number of COVID-19 cases in Tokyo continues to rise (there were 47 new cases announced yesterday!) and I'm torn on what the right thing to do. It seems silly to risk something as important as (in an extreme case) the lives of my family for a couple of hours of 'school' a day. On the other hand, I'm not an expert and the experts are apparently suggesting that this is all right. I read Patrick McKenzie's [post](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/) about his role in trying in March and April to get people in Japan to recognise that infections were far more prevalent than generally recognised. I [asked](https://twitter.com/pyrmont/status/1271350622197972992) him what he thought about the current situation but no response.

- Disney+ launched in Japan and I was ready for it to replace the pretty rough Disney Deluxe service ([Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ディズニーデラックス)) that Docomo has been running since early 2019. Alas, Disney+ _is_ Disney Deluxe, just with a minor visual refresh. Docomo handles the billing (and so you can't pay with your iTunes account), it's missing features (e.g. separate user accounts) and you're stuck using its shitty apps (the Disney+ apps from other territories don't work with it). I signed up to check it out and then almost immediately cancelled. It's a real shame because I was looking forward to the kids being able to watch things in either English or Japanese.

- Speaking of animation in Japanese (apologies for that), I watched _Lupin III: The First_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_III:_The_First)). I thought the quality of the CG animation was top notch—unfortunately the story was not. It prompted me to start watching _The Castle of Cagliostro_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro)) again to see how it compares. I think it drags in places but it revealed the central issue with _The First_: Lupin succeeds at almost everything he tries and in the rare instances where he doesn't, he has something up his sleeve (sometimes quite literally) that immediately fixes the problem.

- I couldn't find anything explaining why this was but Fischerspooner recently re-released their 2001 hit, 'Emerge' ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/emerge-remastered-2020/1513667738?i=1513667747)). It was featured in the fifth episode of season 3 of _Westworld_. Is that the reason?
