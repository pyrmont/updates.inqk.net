- I forgot to write about this last week but after growing my hair for more than six months, I finally got it cut. Even after all that time it wasn't especially long and I have no idea how men in 80s rock bands have hair that long ([Poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_(band)), I'm talking about Poison).

- The actual haircut was, well, it wasn't interesting _to you_ but I have three small children and get my kicks where I can find them. So, there's a cut-price barber near the train station that I've patronised since we moved here. I've never especially liked the vibe of the place, though, and when I walked in to discover (a) a queue and (b) the prices have increased another 100 yen, I decided to check out a place closer to our house. It's on the second floor (first to citizens of Commonwealth countries) of a building and was hilariously low budget: the chair wasn't a special hairdresser chair and the mirror was just a full-length mirror that was in front of the ordinary chair. Surprisingly the barber looked about my age rather than geriatric. He was fast and I was out of there in six minutes. I never get anything especially challenge so it's not that impressive but still, will definitely return.

- I finished Walter Isaacson’s _Elon Musk_, partly on the Kindle, partly through the Audible app. The book did make me a little more predisposed to Musk than I might have been in the past but more than anything it made me see Musk's manic approach to his companies as really a belief that the way to manage business successfully is to periodically cut too much so you can find what's unnecessary and then put only that back. I want to say it's a shame he's such an arsehole but maybe you need some arseholes for this kind of stuff?

- So after not doing very much programming for… a while, I've relapsed and spent a silly amount of time working on Janet. Of course, it's not one of the _existing_ projects I have: it's a new one, a Janet client for the Conjure plugin for Neovim. Conjure has two existing plugins—one of which [I have already contributed to](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1614005220.html)!—but they don't really work well for editing code across a project and I had an idea about how to do it. I have a [proof of concept](https://github.com/pyrmont/conjure/tree/5fe634a47f7a9d6b5274d3dfbffaa8030e664640) but what I'm already working towards something much more programmatic. It's basically what I hoped Clojure's prepl had been (I wanted to make _prepl_ a hyperlink and the fact that I couldn't find a good page explaining it on the Clojure website tells you all you need to know).

- Lindsay Ellis put a [video essay](https://youtu.be/SMOABV_zgrk) on YouTube! It's over 100 minutes and is called 'Yoko and the Beatles' even though it's really about the modern concept of celebrity and while it's been on Nebula for a while now, I still haven't subscribed so I hadn't seen it yet and I loved it.

- I've never been that into sketch comedy on YouTube, but did really like [this one](https://youtu.be/zhbL8FFKARg) about a band of fantasy heroes that The Algorithm™ suggested to me. Good job, Algorithm.

- It's a YouTube link trifecta this week because rather than something on Apple Music, I wanted to link to this cover of Coldplay's 'Viva la Vida' in the style of the Strokes and it's not there ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/Xa0hd-JqFSY)). Enjoy!
