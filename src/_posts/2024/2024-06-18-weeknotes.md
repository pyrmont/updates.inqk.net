- Rowan turned three and John turned seven. Rowan had a cake Mum brought from Australia that you could prepare in a microwave (and which smelt very good) and John had a Pikachu ice-cream cake from Baskin Robbins that he’d requested. He’s not especially interested in Pikachu so I’m not sure why he wanted it but I had a little and it was great, too.

- Over the course of the week, Apple held their [Worldwide Developers Conference 2024](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/wwdc24-highlights/) at their headquarters in Cupertino. I didn’t have the stamina to last until 2 am for the Monday morning keynote and so just watched the stream when I woke up. The big announcement was about [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/) but more significant to me was the news that the Vision Pro is going on sale in Japan on Friday 24 June.

- Now that shit has, as they say, got real, I’ve spent the week trying to decide whether I would really spend ¥600,000+ to get one. The most I’ve ever spent on a computer is the ¥270,000 I spent for the MacBook Pro 13” back in 2017 and I never felt like I got my money’s worth with that machine. As I’ve written about before, my expected use-case is watching movies and TV shows and ¥600,000 is a lot to do that (especially when I can—to an admittedly far lesser extent—do that on my iPad).

- One of the factors complicating things is that the developer announcements at WWDC have once again whetted my appetite to do more development for Apple platforms. It’s been a frustrating few years with SwiftUI but it does improve every year and there are a couple of apps I’d like to try my hand at making, most notably a replacement for my beloved [Reporter](http://reporter-app.com). It hasn’t been updated in years and can no longer collect weather information since the Dark Sky API has been shut down. I also wouldn’t mind making a very simple fasting app so that I can avoid needing to renew my [Zero](https://zerolongevity.com) subscription when it runs out.

- I cheated at Wordle. I don’t know how this happened but I somehow didn’t open the site on Saturday at all and by the time I’d realise, it was 12.30 am. I’ve been in this situation once before and I realised then that I could have saved my streak by setting my device clock back an hour. So I pretended to be in Shanghai and then solved the puzzle in two guesses!

- Forgetting on Saturday was especially strange because we didn’t do that much that day. I took Emma and John to Yoyogi Chapters with Mum tagging along but then both kids had a playdate with a family who we used to live near and so as soon as class was over we turned around and came right back.

- Sunday was more action-packed. Mum and I took Rowan to the [Railway Museum](https://www.railway-museum.jp) in Omiya. The pièce de résistance was meant to be a ride back from Omiya in the E5 shinkansen but I didn’t plan the timing well and we would have had to wait 45 minutes. We instead made do with an E7 shinkansen instead (which Rowan has [already ridden](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1715084400.html)). This was especially frustrating because as we waited for the E7, I saw an E5 on another platform. I realised I’d mistakenly asked the man at the ticket window about tickets on the Hayabusa (which is the name the E5 has when it does the Tokyo-Shin-Aomori run) but there are other routes the E5 takes. Live and learn, I suppose.

- My Japanese study has not been going well.

- My fasting has been going well. I reached my lowest in years at 67.46kg!

- Every now and then I hear the word ‘calamity’ and sing to myself ‘Holy calamity, scream insanity, all you ever gonna be's another great fan of me’. I could never remember the name of the song but finally looked it up and it’s 'Holy Calamity (Bear Witness II)' from Handsome Boy Modeling School’s 1999 _So... How’s Your Girl?_ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/holy-calamity-bear-witness-ii-feat-dj-shadow-dj-quest/1607689963?i=1607689971)).
