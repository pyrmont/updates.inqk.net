- I recovered all the files from my [corrupted hard drive](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1724661660.html) (!). After all else failed, I tried using the Linux command line utility, `ddrescue`, to create a reconstructed copy of the raw bits that were on the broken disk (I largely followed [this very helpful guide](https://www.tauceti.blog/posts/clone-failing-harddisk-partition-with-ddrescue/)). I then opened that copy on my Mac and transferred all the files to another external disk. As best as I can tell, everything was recovered and I’ve spent the last few days feeling the kind of relief reserved for airline pilots who avoid near-miss collisions. Special thanks to sogaiu who patiently endured my one-sided dialogues as I gradually felt my way to a solution (and who—most importantly—provided the link to the aforementioned guide!).

- We’re in negotiations to extend our lease for 12 months (!). Loyal readers might remember that I started collecting the documents for permanent residency back [in May](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1716898980.html) and I’m ashamed to say that I’ve done almost nothing since then. Fortunately, it looks like the universe has handed me a reprieve because the agent responsible for the apartment called out of the blue to ask if we wanted to stay an extra year. While Eri and I do want to move somewhere permanent, neither of us are eager to go through the rigmarole of moving, so putting that off in true Millennial fashion sounds pretty good to us. (Hopefully I haven’t jinxed things by writing about it here.)

- Speaking of shame, here we are at the beginning of September and I’m ashamed to say that I’ve only taken the kids to the community pool _once_ this summer. Partly this is because Emma and John go to a swimming class every Sunday morning and it feels a bit silly to take them to another pool after that. Still, you know what else feels silly? Visiting your nearby community pool once in the three months it’s open.

- I neglected to mention that I had a medical check-up about two weeks ago with the doctor who’s been the primary care physician for my cyst. She’s satisfied with the way the wound has healed post-surgery and since it has basically been a year since I was discharged, she said there wasn’t any immediate risk of recurrence and no longer any need for me to undergo regular examinations. In other words, it’s over! I originally underwent surgery in 2015 so that means it took almost a decade to resolve but what a relief to finally be done with it. (The doctor did say there is still a risk of a similar problem occurring in the future so hopefully I’m not jinxing things here either.)

- I’m not sure Scott Alexander could have chosen a title more likely to attract my interest than [‘Matt Yglesias Considered as the Nietzchean Superman’](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/matt-yglesias-considered-as-the-nietzschean). It’s a long post but if you’re like me, that just means more to enjoy.

- Did you know that the 90s earworm ‘Cotton Eye Joe’ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Eye_Joe_(Rednex_song))) by Swedish Eurodance group Rednex is a reinterpretation of an American folk song (alternatively known as Cotton-Eyed Joe’)? I did not and found this 20-minute [video essay](https://youtu.be/drI-N1SxZVA) by Noah Lefevre (aka Polyphonic) about the song’s history completely fascinating.

- Lefevre mentions that his favourite version of the song is Nina Simone’s cover. I agree that it’s pretty rad ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cotton-eyed-joe-mono-2017-remastered-version/1333497817?i=1333498082)).
