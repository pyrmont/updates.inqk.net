- I visited DisneySea for the first time! Mum, Emma, John and I stayed at the [Hyatt Regency Tokyo Bay](https://hyattregencytokyobay.jp/) on Saturday night and then Emma and I went to DisneySea on Sunday while Mum and John visited the Sheraton Hotel and took advantage of its kid-oriented activities (John’s not a big fan of theme parks at this stage). Overall, I was pretty impressed with DisneySea. The way they had distinct ‘lands’ that nevertheless had some water-related aspect to them was well done. While a decent number of the rides were largely just reskinned versions of rides from Disneyland, they were still fun.

- The one aspect that was a genuine disappointment was their IT backend. The big new attraction is the addition of [Fantasy Springs](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/topics/info/fantasysprings.html). This is a new land that includes rides relating to _Peter Pan_, _Rapunzel_ and (the big one) _Frozen_. To avoid having the entire area be crushed, they’ve gated Fantasy Springs such that you can’t get inside unless you have booked at least a standby booking for one of the rides. You do this through the Disney Resort app and you will be shocked to hear, dear reader, that this app barely worked. I was fortunately able to make one booking (for Peter Pan’s Never Land) so we did get in but after that, the app kept failing to work and I wasn’t able to do anything else with it. Fortunately, that wasn’t too big an impediment and Emma and I still had a great time. I’m already keen to go back (even if I do think the multiple times we went on [Flounder’s Flying Fish Coaster](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tds/attraction/detail/237/)).

- On Saturday night, rather than go to the fancy restaurants in the Hyatt, we instead caught the shuttle bus to Disneyland and went to [Chef Mickey](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/hotel/dah/restaurant/chef.html) in the Disney Ambassador Hotel. The buffet food wasn’t anything to write home (blog?) about but the kids had a blast at the end of the meal when a performer dressed up as Mickey Mouse came around to the table and posed for a bunch of photos.

- As you can probably imagine, with the combination of a buffet dinner, a buffer breakfast and a lot of in-park popcorn, I put the dieting to one side for most of the weekend. My weight went back up over 70kg but has already dropped back to 69kg.

- Yes, it’s that time of year: I wrote something on my blog! It’s my seventh annual [list of podcasts I listen to](https://articles.inqk.net/2024/05/30/podcasts-spring-2024.html). I probably wrote about this last year but it kills me that the title for this series ends in a preposition. If I did write about this last year, I no doubt noted that I keep wondering how stupid it would be to rename the series to ‘Podcast to Which I Listen’ before concluding each time that it would be far too stupid.

- Perhaps because of the post, I promptly listened to a lot fewer episodes this week and instead started listening to audiobooks again (!). Rather than sign up for a subscription, I bought the audio book of Walter Isaacson’s _Elon Musk_ (which I’m partway through reading on the Kindle) and started listening to it. Maybe there won’t be a list of podcasts next year?

- I’m so out of the loop when it comes to contemporary music, I have no idea how popular Beabadoobee is but I was listening to her 2022 album, _Beatopia_, and immediately took a liking to ‘The Perfect Pair’ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-perfect-pair/1631390001?i=1631390129)).
