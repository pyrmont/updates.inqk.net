- It's been almost uniformly fantastic weather for the past week. [As James observed recently](https://jamesvandyne.com/487f2957-ca75-438f-911c-c39bc961c055), it's too warm for May but sunny skies in the mid- to high-20s are still quite pleasant.

- The weather was particularly nice on Saturday and so rather than just go home after Yoyogi Chapters, I took Emma and John to the [National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo](https://www.momat.go.jp/en). MOMAT as it's abbreviated (notwithstanding the N that's clearly begging to be there) didn't have any special exhibitions on at the moment so we just perused the works in their regular collection. I don’t know if it really had much of an impact on the kids; I imagine the value of doing these kind of cultural excursions at this age is largely about normalising the experience of going to galleries and museums.

- Apple announced new iPads at their [‘Let Loose’ event](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-stunning-new-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-pro/). I was discussing the products with Brandon and while I’d be tempted to get an iPad Pro if iPadOS could run Xcode, as things stand now, the software I would want to use doesn’t exist on the iPad. Maybe something will be announced at WWDC to change the status quo.

- I’ve managed to keep the fasting going over the past week. I am losing weight, although there’s a fair bit of fluctuation depending on whether I’m weighing during a fast or afterward (a lot of which is water loss, I assume). Still, the trend is in the right direction and I intend to keep it going.

- I’ve got about three more episodes of _Seinfeld_ to go depending on whether you want to count the clip-show, ‘The Chronicle’ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicle_(Seinfeld))), and while I’m still enjoying watching the episodes, I can see why Jerry Seinfeld decided that the show had run its course after this season. [I defended](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1713245760.html) the earlier season nine episode ‘The Betrayal’ a couple of weeks ago, but I can’t deny the show feels more gimmicky than it did in season eight.

- I was wondering why I haven’t got that much done this week but then remembered how much time in the evenings is taken up by the NBA Play-Offs. Probably a poor long-term choice on my part but I really enjoyed watching the first two games of the Minnesota and Denver series. Denver has since come back to level the series 2-2, a feat that is all the more impressive given that they did it by winning the games in Minnesota _and_ that they did it after one of the most comprehensive drubbings of a professional basketball team I’ve ever seen in Game 2.

- Last week, [I recommended](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1715084400.html) Rocket Jump’s 18-minute ‘How Star Wars was Saved in the Edit’. This week, I (slowly) made it through a 117-minute dismantling called [‘How “How Star Wars was saved in the edit” was saved in the edit (sort of, but not really)’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olqVGz6mOVE). It’s too long by... well quite a bit more than half, so I don’t recommend it to anyone to actually watch but it does a comprehensive job illustrating how the argument in the first video is wrong and, as a result, I’ve revised my opinion and posted a correction to last week’s updates.

- David Hartley has a video essay entitled [‘Why the world’s biggest song caused Gotye to quit’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUiqZ68TcE) that of course led to me listening to more Gotye. ‘Somebody That I Used to Know’ is obviously a masterpiece but my favourite will always be his earlier ‘Hearts a Mess’ from _Like Drawing Blood_ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/hearts-a-mess-new-version/1443103513?i=1443103686)).
