I'm glad to see [David Smith argue](http://david-smith.org/blog/2019/01/28/wishing-for-a-low-end-apple-watch) for a low-cost Apple Watch. He doesn't make quite the same points as [I made](http://david-smith.org/blog/2019/01/28/wishing-for-a-low-end-apple-watch) last March but I still believe this is a product that should exist.
