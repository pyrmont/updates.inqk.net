- I neglected to mention last week that Japan held its House of Councillors (i.e. upper house) election on Sunday 20 July ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Japanese_House_of_Councillors_election)). If you've heard about this election at all, it's probably because of the performance of Sanseitō, a right-wing populist party that attracted attention for advocating for a 'Japan First' policy platform and criticising foreigners in Japan for certain practices. Japan's Liberal-Democratic Party is a centre-right party that's generally kept more conservative elements of Japan in check but they're arguably at one of the weakest moments in their history and I feel some trepidation about the party splintering and more radical elements eventually wielding political power.

- On Saturday I took Rowan over to Yokohama. I've always wanted to go down to the Bay and so after catching a Shōnan-Shinjuku train down to Yokohama, we went to the end of the Minatomirai Line and over to Yamashita Park ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita_Park)). There's a ship, the _Hikawa Maru_, that's permanently berthed next to the park and while I thought about going aboard, it was extremely hot outside and Rowan was pretty eager to get back home. Something for another time.

- I've had [another bout](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1706018520.html) of 'I should use IRC more'. The catalyst of all things was a random comment on the computing community website, [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/), about its IRC channel. I was a heavy IRC user throughout high school but when I tried to get back into IRC in the late 2010s, I wanted some of the affordances (mobile clients, push notifications, continuous connection) we've come to expect from group messaging apps. The best solution I could find was [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/). It's not bad but given how little I ever do end up using IRC, I couldn't justify its price and finally cancelled it earlier this year. Cut to this weekend and I realised all I really need is a tmux session running on my Linode. After some struggles with the venerable client [irssi](https://irssi.org/), I stumbled across relative upstart [catgirl](https://git.causal.agency/catgirl/). It doesn't work exactly the way I want but it's very close. I'm currently debating whether to fork the project and create my own version that would fix the one or two niggles I have. Viva la open source?

- There must be something in the air because now the YouTube channel Trash Theory has done an episode related to the alternative rock of the late 90s, this time [focusing on the Offspring](https://youtu.be/Pfi8iX3Y938).

- Speaking of the music of the late 90s, a meme went around Bluesky the other day that involves posting the album covers of four 'perfect' albums from the year you turned 16. That's 1998 for me which, as I attempted to assemble my list, really can't hold a candle to 1997. I [settled on](https://bsky.app/profile/pyrmont.inqk.net/post/3luxawrw4l224) Morcheeba's _Big Calm_, Faithless' _Sunday 8PM_, Massive Attack's _Mezzanine_ and Fatboy Slim's _You've Come a Long Way, Baby_.

- In putting my list together, I was looking up Triple J's Hottest 100 from that year and noticed that at some point Apple Music added 'curators' (as opposed to ordinary users). This is a perfect categorisation for Triple J and gives them a fancy landing page on which to list things like their playlists, featured albums and video segments ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/jp/curator/triple-j/1697389205?l=en-US)).
