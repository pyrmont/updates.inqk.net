- [Issue #300](https://updates.inqk.net/weeknotes/2025.html)!

- Monday was Sports Day, which is officially the スポーツの日 but which I insist on referring to in Japanese as 体育の日 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Day_(Japan))). That made it a three-day weekend and I did a separate thing on each day with each child:

  - On Saturday, I went with Rowan to Asobono. We went relatively late in the afternoon and so basically had to turn around and come home as soon as we were finished there (much to Rowan’s regret).

  - On Sunday, I took John bowling. I did not think this through properly and realised only after we got into the alley itself (which was after waiting 90 minutes) that all of the bowling balls were too heavy for John. They did have bumpers that at least allowed him to not constantly roll his ball into the gutter but it wasn’t quite the event I had hoped it would be. Fortunately, the bowling alley we attended had a small game arcade and John was able to play a couple of rounds of the arcade version of _Minecraft Dungeons_.

  - On Monday, Emma and I went to see the Pretty Cure movie. Regular readers might remember that I had bought a ticket with Rowan back in mid-September but that the noise had been too much and so I’d had to exit early. What I’d seen in the first 10 minutes didn’t especially grab me and I had worried the 70-minute running time would feel more like infinity. Fortunately, that was not the case! Eri had told me she thought it was much better than she’d been expecting and I have to agree.

- I managed to fast for 42 hours across Saturday and Sunday. Yay!

- [During the early months of the pandemic](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1589765100.html), I released a Janet library called [Musty](https://github.com/pyrmont/musty). Musty was an incomplete implementation of the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io) templating language that uses Janet’s parser expression grammar (PEG) engine. I say ‘incomplete’ because Musty did not fully support the Mustache specification. I found it too difficult to get something working with PEGs that could also handle custom delimiters and partials. Five a bit years later I got a request to add support for partials. I took this as the impetus to rewrite the entire thing as a handwritten recursive descent parser that now passes the mandatory parts of the Musty spec. I haven’t implemented the optional parts; I guess that’s what I’ll do in another five years.

- I bought a colour laser printer. It’s the Brother HL-L3240CDW and I’m hoping it maintains its colours and tone for a decent amount of time.

- A few years ago, [Brandon mentioned the musician Sigrid](https://sangsara.net/2022/05/09/week-19-22/) in the context of her 2022 album, _How to Let Go_. I remember listening to it then and not feeling much at first. But after hearing an acoustic version of ‘It Gets Dark’ on an Apple Music home session EP that Sigrid recorded during the pandemic, I became a fan. I’ve been eagerly awaiting the release of _There’s Always More That I Could Say_ for the past couple of months. It’s scheduled for release on 24 October 2025 but three of the singles are available to stream. I’ve been listening to them all a lot but but the one that’s stuck the firmest in my head is ‘Fort Knox’ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fort-knox/1828716691?i=1828716856&l=en-US)).
