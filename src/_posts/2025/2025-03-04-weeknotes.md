- This will be the last update I write while we are living in our current apartment. Despite the boxes everywhere, it still doesn’t feel real that we’re about to move into our own house.

- Speaking of boxes, we’ve been working to avoid bringing too much to the new house that we don’t actually need and that’s meant some hard choices have to be made. The most painful decision so far has been throwing out a puzzle we got when Emma was a baby. It’s one of those ones made for very young children where the pieces fit into the puzzle board, each piece having a little peg for the child to grip. The one we had had 14 pieces with each piece representing a common ‘thing’ like the Sun, the Moon, a tree and so on. Everything else being equal, it shouldn’t have been as hard to put it in the garbage as it was. Back in our _previous_ place, we’d lost the alarm clock piece and so the puzzle is technically ‘broken’. I did get Eri to take a photo of me holding it one last time.

- The air conditioners were originally meant to have been installed on Monday but it was forecast to snow so the tradesman called and asked if it could be rescheduled til Thursday. Fingers crossed the weather is a bit better on that day and that there are no problems with the installation.

- We were able to get the curtain rails put in on Saturday. We had originally intended to buy custom curtains but we decided to take the curtains we’re currently using and put those up while we decide on (read: put aside a second dowry for) the curtains we actually want to get.

- I started dieting more rigorously again this week. I’m not being quite as strict about the fasts as I was last year (primarily, I allow myself milk teas) but that caveat aside, I was able to string together three and my weight is back down to 68.5.

- I meant to write this last week but a friend commented on how feckless the Democrats in the United States seem. I responded with simply ‘Dems be so... _feck_less’. Confused why this did not provoke peals of uncontrollable laughter, I followed up and the friend admitted she didn’t get the reference. It was of course an (incredible) allusion to Australian Crawl’s 1983 hit ‘Reckless’ ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/yEPp5gJaCXM)). My talents are wasted on you people.

- If you’re looking for some video essays to watch:

  - Vox has a [10-minute exploration](https://youtu.be/UBc38VjI7NU) on how de-aging technology has improved over the last 15 or so years.

  - Christopher Bingham released the [first episode](https://youtu.be/9MmgHKLGQZc) in a short series of essays he’s making about _Groundhog Day_.

  - Henry Jackson (AKA Big Joel) returns to [critically discuss](https://youtu.be/Vd5BbkuCud0) the decline of the conservative film franchise, _God’s Not Dead_.

- Perhaps as some stress relief, I worked on a PR for some changes to the documentation in [Janet](https://janet-lang.org). This wasn’t coding as such but it did require me to read more about Janet’s event loop and while I wouldn’t want to overstate the extent of my understanding, it definitely felt like it moved up a level. I also spent a stunning amount of time trying to understand how to work around a bug that is causing non-deterministic crashes in one of Janet’s automated test suites. This time, I needed to learn more about how Docker works and, again, I took a step forward.

- Calvin Harris’ ‘I’m Not Alone’ ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/jp/album/im-not-alone-radio-edit/324702502?i=324702605&l=en-US)) came on shuffle earlier in the week and I was surprised to see it dates from 2009. That circle just keeps turning, huh?
