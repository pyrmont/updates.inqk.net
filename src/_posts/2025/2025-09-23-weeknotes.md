- I turned 43. Since I consider the [Mac Mini](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1750773600.html) and the [iPad Air](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1752588240.html) to have been quasi-birthday presents, I didn’t try to get anything more (e.g. AirPods Pro 3). That said, as is tradition, I did get the [current Sweets Collection](https://www.cozycorner.co.jp/campaign/newitem/32810.html) from Ginza Cozy Corner. It’s a set of nine pastries inspired by Sanrio’s stable of characters (Hello Kitty, Pompompurin, etc).

- I mentioned [last week](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1758032220.html ) that Eri took Emma and John to see the latest Pretty Cure movie and that even though Rowan wanted to go _and_ there was supposedly a theatre set up for young children, we didn’t let him go, too. Unsurprisingly, Emma and John wanted to see the movie again so on Monday, we gave it a go. Rowan lasted a bit longer than he did the [last time](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1735648920.html) but after about 10 minutes told me he wanted to go. Maybe next year.

- I framed the decision not to buy the AirPods Pro 3 as an exercise in mature self-restraint but it was partly due to the fact I got a free replacement AirPod (singular) courtesy of Apple Care+. This was my first time using Apple Care+ which I don’t normally get after Apple purchases but which I purchased with the AirPods Pro 2 after a history of issues with the non-Pro AirPods. After a brief chat with ‘Royce’, a new right AirPod was couriered over to me. I’m not sure the left one doesn’t need replacing too but the warranty lasts until May of next year so there’s still plenty of time for that.

- I finished _Jedi: Survivor_. As with _Jedi: Fallen Order_, I couldn’t manage to get past four of the bosses without turning the difficulty down. I do feel like this one was a bit more drawn out but I’m sure players who aren’t middle-aged fathers of three  instead see this as more value for their money. According to Wikipedia, there’s a further sequel planned so I’m looking forward to the further adventures of Cal Kestis. Not sure what I’ll play next; I’ll probably give the _Alters_ a fair shake but it’s apparently a survival game and I’ve never been especially interested in those.

- A few years ago, I wrote the overly long-named command-line utility, [Documentarian](https://github.com/pyrmont/documentarian). It provides a way to generate an API document for Janet’s legacy bundles by using the docstrings in the bundle’s modules. I’ve wanted to make it work with Janet’s modern bundles for a while and it occurred to me to build that functionality into [Jeep](https://github.com/pyrmont/jeep), the bundle manager I’ve been working on for the past few weeks. This week I added it as `jeep api`.

- Legacy bundle? Modern bundle? What am I even talking about? I wrote a [blog post](https://articles.inqk.net/2025/09/15/janet-bundles.html) to explain those very things.

- I watched two video essays that helped clarify what it sets the essayists I watch regularly apart. Patrick Willems has an essay about [digital deaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7RCfYcJFbw) that’s not his absolute best but sets up and prosecutes an argument against the use of digital deaging. It runs for 50 minutes. In comparison, the channel From the Screen has a [15-minute essay about _Inside Man_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2jrFHwRtoI). Despite being more than three times as short, there’s very little to it. It makes the observation that _Inside Man_ takes advantage of the expectations that the audience brings to a heist movie but then mostly just repeats that ad nauseam.

- My Friends Mix playlist on Apple Music included a track from _Amnesiac_ this week because [Brandon](https://sangsara.net) had been listening to it. What a great album ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/amnesiac/1097864180)).
