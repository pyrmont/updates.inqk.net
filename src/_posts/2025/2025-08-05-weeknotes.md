- It’s very hot. With the kids home for the school holidays, I’ve been working more from home and that’s allowed me avoid going out too much.

- The _New York Times_ wrote about [geoengineering as a way to protect the Great Barrier Reef](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/magazine/manmade-clouds-coral-barrier-reef.html). Last year, the _Times_ wrote a [similar story](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/climate/david-keith-solar-geoengineering.html). As I said then, I’m of the opinion that this is the way we’re ultimately going to address climate change. I can see why that’s not the ideal solution—and I’m sympathetic to those who feel it’s cheating— but I believe at some point enough people are going to demand governments ‘do something’ to address elongated, and increasingly oppressive, summers.

- I wrote last week about using the IRC client, [catgirl](https://git.causal.agency/catgirl/). I mentioned that it didn’t work quite how I wanted it to and that I was considering forking it. Well, dear reader, fork it I did. I haven’t put the code up anywhere yet but I have a version that uses different colours, adds a couple of shortcuts and supports Vim-like modal scrolling. I’d like to implement the ability to search through the channel history but I’m not sure how difficult that will be.

- I was preparing to put the project up on GitHub for all to see but got bogged down writing a manpage. Catgirl has great manpages—not a huge surprise given the primary author [literally writes her blog](https://text.causal.agency/002-writing-mdoc.txt) in the manpage format, mdoc—and I thought it would be a shame to have forked the project and then deleted those great manpages. But while June McEnroe might write her blog in mdoc, I write mine in Markdown. It seemed impossible that there wasn’t a good tool for doing this but I wasn’t particularly satisfied with any of the solutions (e.g. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/) or [Ronn](https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/)). So of course I’ve started making my own. Part of the issue is that I want something that uses the newer mdoc ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandoc)) rather than the older roff format ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roff_(software))). Over the past couple of days, I’ve put together a basic proof of concept of a Janet script that creates mdoc documents from text files written in a Markdown variant I’ve devised.

- I mentioned [two weeks ago](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1752588240.html) that I’d set up Xbox Cloud Gaming on my Steam Deck. It’s worked really well (and has contributed to me slowly getting through _Jedi: Survivor_). So well, in fact, that I wondered how it would be on my iPad. Turns out it’s great there, too!

- With all the gaming and programming, it’s perhaps not a surprise that my studying has suffered. I do want to keep on top of that because it felt like I was on a little bit of a roll.

- I showed the kids _WALL-E_ and we were able to get through it in one setting. I don’t remember when we last tried to watch it but I do remember that we bailed before the end. Some of the shine has undoubtedly worn off Pixar as a result of their more recent work but this was a great reminder of how high those highs were.

- Eugenia sent me a [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/6hyBaLfsz0w) to the viral video Luke Holloway (AKA Lewky) made about a ridiculous Tinder conversation. This isn’t really my thing but the song is so catchy ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/jp/album/i-have-one-daughter-official-extended-feat-sad-alex/1829645724?i=1829645725&l=en-US)), I couldn’t help but fall in love with it.
