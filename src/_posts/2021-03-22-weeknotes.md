- The state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BA01L)). As with previous waves, the 'acceptable' level following this third wave is higher than it was before the wave. In terms of vaccinations, the numbers still seem very low: rising from 40,000 per day at the beginning of the week to about 70,000 per day by the end ([Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/vaccine_sesshujisseki.html)).

- Emma finished school for the Japanese academic year. Her final year of preschool will start in April. It's difficult to believe she's been doing this for two years already.

- We started John's toilet training. That's quite late (he's already three and a half) but we were (a) lazy and (b) waiting until the weather was a bit warmer so that we could reduce the number of soiled items of clothing on each 'miss'.

- I really liked 2018's _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ the first time I saw it but Film Crit Hulk's 'Why SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE Works - A Scene-By-Scene Breakdown' ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aK-ZuyvJY)) really deepened my appreciation for what the script is doing. I watched the movie again and liked it so much I watched it for a third time with Emma and John.

- This is actually from the week prior but I spent a bit of time working on a way to implement a standard library in Janet. A large number of Janet's core functions are written in Janet and this is made possible by serialising this core environment into a byte array that is embedded in the `janet` binary. I took the same idea and implemented a module as a separate byte array that wasn't loaded by default (thereby saving a bit of start-up time). The [pull request](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/pull/656) was rejected but it was an interesting experience and helped me better understand how Janet works.

- Eri and I were discussing pronunciation when she mentioned the odd way that Australians pronounce 'data' (i.e. 'dah-ta'). I was sure this wasn't the case but she was, of course, correct ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEh66ZDlDrQ)) and this revelation is still ricocheting around my head days later.

- I'm almost through the first two seasons of my rewatch of _Law & Order_. I still haven't finished the eight episodes of _Devs_.

- All the _Spider-Verse_ rewatching meant a lot of 'What's Up Danger' ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/whats-up-danger/1445949265?i=1445949266)). It is an _excellent_ song to listen to while you're playing Rocket League.
