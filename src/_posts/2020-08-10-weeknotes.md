- I was thinking it hasn't been that hot this summer and then August began and—bam! It's almost 30 degrees at 11 pm at night. I don't know what I'd do without air conditioning.

- I had another doctor's appointment on Monday and it once again provided me with an opportunity to swing by Mos Burger. It'll be embarrassing if I contract COVID-19 and have to tell the contract tracing people that I just couldn't resist the chance to enjoy a Mos Yasai Burger.

- It felt like I poured almost all my available time into the iOS app I'm currently developing. The basic functionality hasn't changed much since last week, instead I was consumed with a lot of small details. I'm still not at the part yet where you can add your own JavaScript files. Maybe next week.

- I showed the kids _Inside Out_. I think this is actually the second time they'd seen it but if memory serves, they didn't get it at all the first go around. It was more successful on this occasion, at least with Emma. I couldn't find a good way to explain conceptually where Joy and Sadness were when they were whisked away to long term memory so when she asked if they were in Riley's feet, I lied and said yes.

- One of the things I thought I'd do more of after [buying the iPad Pro](https://updates.inqk.net/post/1591590000.html) was read comics but I didn't get Comixology set up properly on it until this week. The first thing I went and bought was [the first collected edition](https://www.comixology.com/Miracleman-Vol-1-A-Dream-Of-Flying-Parental-Advisory-Edition/digital-comic/102178) of Alan Moore's run on _Miracleman_ (prompted to do so by [this Nerdwriter video](https://youtu.be/Z2yZwh_gCIU). It was very Alan Moore but also very good.

- Eri started watching the J-dorama, _Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu_ (逃げるは恥だが役に立つ, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeru_wa_Haji_da_ga_Yaku_ni_Tatsu)). It's not very Alan Moore but is nevertheless very good.

- I don't remember why I had cause to look this up but at some point during the week, I heard an American talk about magpies. Surprised they'd know of such a thing, I had a look on Wikipedia and was startled to discover that Australian magpies are not the same as other magpies.

- One of the best parts of _Nigeru_ is the closing theme ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/koi/1444990715?i=1444990824)). I'm not a big fan of most Japanese musicians but I quite like the artist, Gen Hoshino (he also plays the male lead in the series). Hoshino's sound reminds me of Monkey Majik.
