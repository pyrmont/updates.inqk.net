A problem with the argument that tech companies were right to wait til Wednesday to act (e.g. [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/facebook-and-twitter-suspend-trump-parler-suspended-everywhere-context-and-culture/)) is that it assumes that the rioters were destined to fail. It shouldn't have got this close. Can the right approach be to rely on incompetence?
