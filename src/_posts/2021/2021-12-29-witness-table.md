I've been perplexed by the term _witness table_ recently. It's used in the Swift compiler and everyone seems to treat it like a term of art everyone knows. I [asked on the Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/where-does-the-term-witness-table-come-from/54334) and got a nice answer from @pathofshrines:twitter.com! Constructive logic!
