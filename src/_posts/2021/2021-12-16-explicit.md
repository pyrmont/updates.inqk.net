There's a weird thing with some 90s R&B where a song is censored but there's no apparent 'explicit' version (e.g. Lauryn Hill's 'Doo Wop (That Thing)'). For 'Doo Wop' there is an explicit version on [this vinyl edition](https://www.discogs.com/release/722466-Lauryn-Hill-Doo-Wop-That-Thing) but that's it.
