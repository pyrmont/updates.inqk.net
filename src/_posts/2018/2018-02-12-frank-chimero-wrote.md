Frank Chimero wrote up a talk he’s given a couple of times about [avoiding unnecessary complexity in web programming](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/). One thing he doesn’t suggest is putting unobfuscated/unminified code on GitHub. I think that makes a nice compromise.
