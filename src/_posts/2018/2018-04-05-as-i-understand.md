As I understand it, [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) didn't include a like/heart mechanic in Micro.blog because @mentions make for more meaningful interactions. I agree but then I wish we could turn them off in the timeline. I don't send as many as I'd like because I don't want to spam my followers.
