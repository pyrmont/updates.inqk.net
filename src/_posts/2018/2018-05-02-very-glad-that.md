Very glad that Sunlit now allows you to set a different MB-hosted blog for your photo posting. I really think MB needs better photo-centric themes, though, and I'm not convinced the teeny tiny thumbnail worm is the right way to display/hint at a gallery. /cc [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton), [@cheesemaker](https://micro.blog/cheesemaker)
